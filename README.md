# After Dark : A Library Adventure

## Blurb
After a long day at school, you go and hang out at the library. Tired, you fall asleep in the kid's area and wake up to realize the library has closed! 
Except everything about the library seems off and there is a strange computer terminal in the corner that is able to wreak havoc at the press of a button.

Make the right choices and you may make it out alive.

### Technical Stuff
After Dark is a work of interactive fiction created using Twine + Hawthorne + JS.

### Installation
Create a folder on your public web server and place the files inside.

### I'm Too Lazy to Do That
That's fine -- you can just play it here:
